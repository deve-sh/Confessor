## Editing / Further Developing

For people looking to Develop the project further, or just edit it to their needs; I am sorry, there is no administrator mode for the project like other projects of mine, so for now, the only way to edit the project is by directly editing the source code. However the project is well commented wherever necessary, so editing it might not be a tough play.

## Contributing

For contributions, just make changes to the project that you might feel are necessary or make the project better, and start a pull request.

## License

The Project is License Free. Do whatever you may want to do with it. (As long as its legal and doesn't destroy any one's life.)

## Support

For support and concerns, raise an Issue in the repo or <a href='mailto:devesh2027@gmail.com'>email</a> me.
